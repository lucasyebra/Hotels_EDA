# Hotels_EDA
SQL + POWER BI

Hello! 
In this repository, the idea is to analyze a hotel chain throughout the years 2018, 2019 and 2020 with the aim of answering some questions for the directory.

Firstly, we will check whether revenues have grown in these years, then we will analyze the impact on hotel parking and finally we will try to find trends that help us to improve business.

The first question is worked through a query in sql while the rest we will see visually on our dashboard.

Regarding to parkings, we can see that there is no strong evidence that it is necessary to increase the spaces, perhaps the cost of doing so will end up being negative for the hotels. Then we can see that "City hotel" category is relatively more profitable and requires fewer parking spaces. At the same time, they charge more expensive on average per night and also offer greater discounts to their clients
